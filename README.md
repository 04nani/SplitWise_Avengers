# Splitwise Project

## Overview

This project is a Splitwise-like expense sharing application that allows users to split expenses among friends or groups. The app helps to track who owes whom and simplifies settling expenses through an easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords using secure authentication (via Appwrite SDK).
- **Create and Manage Groups:** Users can create groups, add members, and manage shared expenses.
- **Expense Tracking:** Add expenses with details like description, amount, date, and the members involved in the split.
- **Debt Calculation:** The app automatically calculates who owes whom, based on the expenses added.
- **Expense Settlement:** Users can settle debts between each other, reducing the outstanding amounts.
- **Notifications:** Push notifications inform users when new expenses are added or settled.
- **User Profile:** Users can update their account settings, including name and email, and reset their password.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** 
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
  - React.js (for building UI components)
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express (for handling API requests)
  - Appwrite (for user authentication, database, and cloud functions)
- **Database:** 
  - Appwrite's in-built database for storing user and expense data
- **Version Control:** 
  - Git & GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine.
- **Appwrite server** set up with the following services enabled: authentication, database, cloud functions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/splitwise-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd splitwise-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and configure the necessary environment variables (Appwrite project keys, database IDs, etc.).

   ```
   REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   REACT_APP_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint.com
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Appwrite Setup

1. **User Authentication:** Set up email and password-based authentication in your Appwrite project.
2. **Database:** Create collections for storing user data, groups, and expenses. Configure the necessary permissions for read and write access.
3. **Cloud Functions:** (Optional) Use cloud functions for background jobs like sending notifications or settling group expenses.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up / Log In:** New users can create an account, and existing users can log in using their email and password.
2. **Create a Group:** Once logged in, users can create groups and add members to split expenses.
3. **Add Expense:** Within a group, any member can add an expense, detailing the amount and the people involved.
4. **View Balances:** The app automatically calculates and displays how much each user owes or is owed.
5. **Settle Expenses:** Users can record payments to settle debts.
